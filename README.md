Hi, I'm Ben, aka mrsquee, aka tilbo bennins.

I'm a mathematician, a musician, an educator, and a fullstack developer working in finance, music performance, and music education.

I realised quite recently that I love algorithms. I love abstracting a process into a set of steps.
It could be trying to decompose musical composition into a set of creative algorithms,
or just coming up with an algorithm to make the best and fastest cup of tea in a new kitchen!

If you like listening to algorithmic music, please check out [fractal moth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcowgX29Gl3Kb7UjF4fo1xg62GDg5XtCl)
where you can hear some of the music that I've been generating.

Always looking to exchange and discuss new ideas, so feel free to hit me up on targansaikhan at gmail dot com if anything that you see interests you!

Have a great day, strolling around the interwebz :wave:
